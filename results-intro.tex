\section{Results}
We present our survey results and provide analyses of the data. We first discuss participants' responses to the various data-sharing scenarios, and how data type, data recipient, and device contributed to how threatening a situation was perceived. Next, we discuss participants' risk/benefit assessment of various new technologies relative to well-established technologies. We conclude the section with participants' self-reported concerns about the biggest risks in owning wearable devices.

\subsection{Concern Factors}
Many factors impact participants' concern levels for each scenario: the data recipient, the data type, and whether or not the scenario occurred on a wearable or a smartphone. We analyze each factor individually, as well as present a statistical model of participants' concerns as a function of all of factors, including demographic traits.
