\begin{abstract}
We performed an online survey to examine risk perceptions surrounding wearable computing devices. We examine different data types that might be captured,  and the effect of who the data is shared with. We surveyed 1,784 participants about 88 data types and 4 data recipients to quantify risk perceptions across a wide range of scenarios, and evaluate of which factors contribute to the severity of these risks. Following previous work, we also asked participants to perform a risk/benefit analysis of 20 new technologies along with other well-understood technologies. The results of this study can be used to guide future research in wearable device security, especially research that helps protect sensitive data and design effective privacy notifications or indicators.
