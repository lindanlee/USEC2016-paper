\section{Results}
In this section, we present participants' responses to the various data-sharing scenarios, and discuss how and which various factors contributed to their risk perceptions. We also discuss participants' risk/benefit assessment of various new technologies relative to well-established technologies. We conclude the section with participants' self-reported concerns about the biggest risks in owning wearable devices.

\subsection{Concern Factors}
Many factors can potentially impact participants' concern levels:  the data being shared, with whom the data is shared, and device in question. We analyze each factor individually, as well as present a statistical model of participants' concerns as a function of the above factors and additional demographic traits.
