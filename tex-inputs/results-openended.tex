\subsection{Open-Ended Concerns for Wearables}
We captured participants' reactions to wearable devices as a whole by asking the following open-ended question:

\begin{quotation}
\noindent
\textit{What do you think are the most likely risks associated with wearable devices?}
\end{quotation}

This question was asked along with demographics questions (but before any IUIPC questions, which asked a lot of direct privacy-related questions, to avoid biasing the recipients). The participants were presented with a blank box to write in, with no character limit to their open-ended responses. 

Table \ref{openresponses} shows common user concerns related to wearable devices. Appendix \ref{sec:coding} details the responses categorized in each coding label. Most are related to privacy and security, but this open-ended data gives a sense of what broad categories of concerns are most relevant to users. This can be used to guide research in unexplored use cases. 

In addition to privacy and security in the general sense, significant concerns included being unaware of what the device is collecting, doing, or which information it is using (Being Unaware). Other orthogonal concerns included long-term health effects caused from wearing the device such as cancer from EMF waves (Health) and safety hazards from wearing the device, such as distractions that cause car accidents (Safety). Interestingly, participants were also concerned with resulting changes in social behaviors, such as dependence on devices or spending less time with loved ones (Social Impact).
