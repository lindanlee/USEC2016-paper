\subsubsection{Device}
Participants had unique VURs for scenarios only differing in device. Our participants had a 58.79\% VUR when asked about wearables and 46.64\% VUR when asked about smartphones.The VURs for both devices for all 5 questions are in table ~\ref{deviceVUR}. However, the effect the device has on the VUR is not considered to be statistically significant (see Table ~\ref{betweendevice}). Additionally, there is no statistically significant difference between how people reacted in a given situation; although, participants were statistically significantly upset in Q2. The aforementioned results are only with respect to between subjects analysis, where answers are from participants who received either only the wearables or smartphone version of the 5 questions. Too few instances of participants answering both versions of questions occured (34 in total for all 5 questions) to perform a sound within-subjects analysis. 

{\color {red} talk about the variance of the devices in general--was there more spread for the answers wrt smartphones, cubetastic, or were they kind of all the same?}

%For the between-subjects comparison (i.e., participants who received one question, but not the other), you can do either a chi-square test or Fisher's exact test. Both use a 2 x 2 contingency matrix (i.e., rows are outcomes---upset or not---and columns are conditions---wearable or smartphone). The way to choose between the two tests is based on sample size, generally you use chi-square when there are more than 10-20 samples per cell in the table, but using either is just as valid. For the within-subjects comparisons (i.e., participants received both questions), you would do McNemar's test; which is the within-subjects version of the chi-square test.
