\subsubsection{Device}
Recall that each participant answered two questions drawn from a set of five smartphone misbehaviors. To compare these misbehaviors with misbehaviors on the Cubetastic3000, we included these same five questions amongst the pool of 293 Cubetastic3000 scenarios, only modifying the device in question. In this manner, while all 1,782 participants received two smartphone questions, there were 159 participants who received at least one of these questions in relation to the Cubetastic3000. Across all participants, the VUR was 46.7\% (of 1,782) when describing smartphones, whereas the VUR increased to 58.8\% (of 159) when describing these same misbehaviors on the Cubetastic3000. The VURs for both devices for all 5 questions are in Table \ref{deviceVUR}.

To ensure independence of observations, we performed a Mann-Whitney U test to compare participants' average VURs for the Cuebtastic3000 scenarios (i.e., 159 participants) to the remaining participants' average VURs for the smartphone scenarios (i.e., 1,623 participants). This difference is statistically significant ($U=108,664.0$ with $p<0.0005$), however, the effect size is very small ($r=0.08$). Because of this small effect size, we did not further reduce our statistical power by separately comparing each of the five misbehaviors. We conclude that users are likely to be more wary of misbehaviors occurring on wearable devices than smartphones, but thig difference is likely negligible. The entire effect may be due to participants' familiarity with smartphones, and therefore this effect may disappear as they increasingly encounter more wearable devices.

%{\color {red} talk about the variance of the devices in general--was there more spread for the answers wrt smartphones, cubetastic, or were they kind of all the same?}

%For the between-subjects comparison (i.e., participants who received one question, but not the other), you can do either a chi-square test or Fisher's exact test. Both use a 2 x 2 contingency matrix (i.e., rows are outcomes---upset or not---and columns are conditions---wearable or smartphone). The way to choose between the two tests is based on sample size, generally you use chi-square when there are more than 10-20 samples per cell in the table, but using either is just as valid. For the within-subjects comparisons (i.e., participants received both questions), you would do McNemar's test; which is the within-subjects version of the chi-square test.
