\section{Conclusion} {\color {red} out of date}

We surveyed 2,250 internet users to determine what contributes to a violation of privacy or security, which technologies are risky, and what users think are the biggest risk for operating wearable devices. We examine how upset participants would in  304 scenarios, assessed the risk and benefit for 20 new technologies, and gave open-ended responses to express their concerns. We provide insight into how much and why data, recipient, and device contribute to users' perception of a situation, calibrate answers with existing smartphone literature, and provide a regression model. An assessment of a range of new technologies shows that users perceive new technologies to be low-risk and low-benefit, but we suspect this is due to limited exposure that an average person has with wearables techology. We also state what users perceived as the most significant concerns with respect to wearable devices. We conclude by discussing future research directions in the wearables and user study space.
