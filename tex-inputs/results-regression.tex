\subsubsection{Regression Models} 
\label{sec:regression}
In order to examine the relative effect of each factor on participants' VURs, we construct several statistical models to predict whether a participant would be ``very upset'' with a given scenario based on the data type, data recipient, and their demographic factors (i.e., age, education, gender, and privacy attitudes). We perform binary logistic regressions using generalized estimating equations, which account for our repeated measures experimental design (i.e., each participant contributed multiple data points).

We create several models using two independent variables as predictors: data and recipient. Because the device (i.e., whether they were using the Cubetastic3000 or a smartphone) is only varied for the five smartphone misbehaviors listed in Section \ref{sec:smartphones}, we removed these five  from our models, which resulted in a total of 72 types of data shared with 4 possible recipients. We also used collected demographic factors as covariates: age, gender, education, wearable device ownership (yes/no), and mean IUIPC score. For each model, we performed Wald's test to examine the model effects attributable to each of these parameters. The only covariates that had an observable effect on our models were gender and participants' IUIPC scores, which also exhibited an interaction effect with each other. Thus, we opted to remove the other covariates from our analysis. Table \ref{regression} shows the various models that we examined and the Quasi-Akaike Information Criterion (QIC), which is a goodness-of-fit metric for model selection that also accounts for complexity (lower relative values indicate better fit). As can be seen, the data type was the strongest predictor of VUR.

While these models illustrate the relative weights that users place on information when determining a scenario as truly upsetting, one shortcoming of this approach is its generalizability: the data predictor is categorical and limited to the data that we specifically chose for this study. To make our data set more generalizable to other use cases, we coded each data type in two ways: in terms of broad descriptions of the type of data (e.g., video, audio, etc.) and the type of risk it presents. Two researchers agreed on a codebook and independently coded each of the 72 data types.

The data types fell into the following six possible categories:
\begin{enumerate}[topsep=0pt,itemsep=-1ex,partopsep=1ex,parsep=1ex]
\item Photo
\item Video
\item Audio
\item Behavioral Information
\item Biometric Information
\item Demographic Information
\end{enumerate}

While the first three categories are self-explanatory, the latter three categories are all based on different user characteristics. We defined {\it behavioral information} as observations about the user's activities; {\it biometric information} as measurements of the user's body; and {\it demographic information} as non-biometric information about the user's traits. 

The risks for each data type fell into the following categories:
\begin{enumerate}[topsep=0pt,itemsep=-1ex,partopsep=1ex,parsep=1ex]
\item {\bf Financial:} the loss of money or property.
\item {\bf Image:} the loss of control over one's self-image (e.g., publicizing something embarrassing).
\item {\bf Medical:} the disclosure of medical information.
\item {\bf Physical:} physical harm to the user.
\item {\bf Relationships:} damage to the user's inter-personal relationships.
\end{enumerate}

After independently coding, the researchers met to resolve any disagreements, such that the results reflect unanimity. There was  83\% agreement prior to resolution. Cohen's $\kappa$ was 0.81 for the data categories and 0.75 for the  risk categories, both indicating ``excellent'' agreement~\cite{Fleiss2003}. 

With regard to data types, the most concerning type of data is video (78.0\%), which was ranked similarly to photos (76.2\%). Next are audio (66.8\%) and demographic data (65.4\%), followed by behavioral (53.1\%) and biometric (46.3\%) data. We suspect that demographic data was more concerning because it included information such as a Social Security Number, bank account information, and other financial information. We chose to categorize them as such as they are non-biological descriptors of the user. We were very surprised that biometric information was seen as relatively benign compared to the other broad categories of data. One hypothesis is that since most home users do not use biometric authentication, they may have an inaccurate understanding of the types of systems that might be at risk if biometric data is stolen and abused.

With regard to the presented risks, we observed that average VURs were highest for financial information disclosure (82.0\%). Information regarding relationships (69.2\%), physical safety (66.4\%), and self-image (65.8\%) followed. VURs were lowest for medical information disclosure (47.4\%). One reason why medical risks were ranked relatively low is that this category broadly covered scenarios involving data about the user's health, but also included more basic medical information, such as age, gender, and emotional state. As mentioned in Section \ref{sec:datatypes}, participants saw these as publicly observable and unconcerning.

Using these two new variables as additional independent variables (and removing the previous data type variable), we created a second set of models. Because these risk categories and mediums are less likely to change over time, models that take these into account are likely to be more useful and less likely to be overfit. What these models show us is that both risk and medium are relatively strong predictors by themselves, and have an even stronger interaction effect. When the data recipient and covariates are added to the model, the resulting goodness-of-fit is not much worse than that of the model using the actual data type. %The full model can be found in Appendix \ref{sec:regression-apx2}.
