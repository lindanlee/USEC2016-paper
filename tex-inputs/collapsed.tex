\section{Concern Factors}
\label{sec:concerns-appendix} 
We show the full, fine-grained results of our survey in this appendix. This includes how participants had ranked each technology in response to the Fischhoff-style questions, the VUR rates for all seventy-two data types, across all recipients and by recipient, and the details of the full regression models used in our analyses.
