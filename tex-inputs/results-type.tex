\subsubsection{Data Type}
Based on our data, we observed that the largest effect stemmed from the data type being shared in a scenario. We present various statistical models in section \ref{sec:regression} to support this conclusion. The 10 most and 10 least concerning data types can be seen in Table \ref{top10}. 

Regardless of the data recipient or the device, participants were most concerned about photos and videos, especially if they contained embarrassing content, nudity, or financial information. As seen in Table \ref{top10}, photos and videos accounted for 5 of the top 10 concerns, {\color {red} and are unanimously considered to be concerning}. Information that could be used to impersonate someone (e.g., usernames/passwords for websites) or invade privacy (photos of someone at home) were also among the most concerning data types. 

Also regardless of the other factors, the least concerning data types mostly consisted of information that could be observed through observations of public behavior, such as demographic information (e.g., age, gender, language spoken). {\color {red} As seen in Table \ref{top10}, participants had distributed opinions on how risky this information was to be shared. A possibility is that people rated these as unconcerning because of unfamiliarity in what applications would use this data for, or because there does not seem to be any immediate financial, social, or physical consequences from having this information shared.}

{\color {red} talk about the variance of the data types here, referring to the table in the appendix. Which were the highest in variance? Which were the unanimous? Which one had a spread? Were there any that were specifically polarized? J has yet to give me the table for this so I can talk about it. But the most unanimous ones seemed to be the highest-concerning ones, whereas the least concerning ones were more distributed. There are not any which are unanimously considered medium risk or to be not risky.}

%A statistical analysis regarding the significance and confidence of <data> types with respect to all 72 was not performed due to the space constraints of the paper. We do consider all <data> categories in our statistical model, which provides an analysis of what factors had contributed to the perceived severity of a particular situation.
