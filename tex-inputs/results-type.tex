\subsubsection{Data Type}
Based on our data, we observed that the largest effect stemmed from the data type being shared in a scenario. We present various statistical models in section \ref{sec:regression} to support this conclusion. The 10 most and 10 least concerning data types can be seen in Table \ref{top10}. 

Regardless of the data recipient or the device, participants were most concerned about photos and videos, especially if they contained embarrassing content, nudity, or financial information. As seen in Table \ref{top10}, photos and videos accounted for 5 of the top 10 concerns. Information that could be used to impersonate someone (e.g., usernames/passwords for websites) or invade privacy (photos of someone at home) were also among the most concerning data types. 

Also regardless of the data recipient, the least concerning data types mostly consisted of information that could be observed through observations of public behavior, such as demographic information (e.g., age, gender, language spoken). It is possible that people rated these as unconcerning because they think many entities already track this data (e.g., shows watched, music listened to, exercise patterns).

%A statistical analysis regarding the significance and confidence of <data> types with respect to all 72 was not performed due to the space constraints of the paper. We do consider all <data> categories in our statistical model, which provides an analysis of what factors had contributed to the perceived severity of a particular situation.
