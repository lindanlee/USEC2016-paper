\begin{abstract}
Wearable devices bring great benefits but also new potential privacy and security risks that could expose users' activities without their awareness or consent.
Effective design of notifications and security controls for wearable devices will require careful attention to prevent habituation and treat user as a scarce resource, which requires understanding which risks have the potential to be most concerning to users.
In this paper, we conduct a large-scale survey to investigate user security and privacy concerns regarding wearable devices. We surveyed 1,784 Internet users for their perceptions of wearable devices and identify risks that are particularly concerning to users, measure the effect of data type and data recipient on perceived risk, study users' self-reported concerns, and compare wearable device risks to those of more familiar technologies.
We hope that this work will inform design of future privacy and security controls for wearable devices.
