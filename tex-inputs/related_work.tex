\section{Related Work}
%%% better introduction, or take this out. This seems awkward. 
%We discuss related work that has examined users' perceptions surrounding security and privacy risks.

\subsection{Ubiquity and Wearable Devices}
Many authors have emphasized that we are rapidly moving towards a world of ubiquitous sensing and data capture, with ensuing privacy challenges~\cite{abowd2000charting,palen2003unpacking,camp2000internet}. Many researchers have worked to study how privacy can be preserved in the presence ubiquitous devices. Examples of such efforts include frameworks to design for privacy~\cite{bellotti1993design,camp2003designing,langheinrich2001privacy}, protocols for anonymous communication {cornelius2008anonysense}, evaluation metrics for privacy ~\cite{scholtz2004toward}, and privacy models ~\cite{hong2004privacy, jiang2002approximate}. However, none of these works attempted to quantify or rank user concern over different privacy risks. 

Roesner et al.\ urge the community to address potential concerns for wearable devices before the technologies become widespread \cite{roesner2014security} and explore the unique and difficult problems these devices present in terms for law and policy \cite.{roesner2014augmented}. A small-scale interview of how bystanders feel about wearable devices found that bystanders were predominantly split between having indifferent and negative reactions to the device but expressed clear interest in being able to give permissions for the data being captured \cite{denning2014situ}. We hope our research furthers   work in communicating with users and bystanders. 

\subsection{Smartphones}
Many researchers have attempted to study user concerns about security or privacy issues associated with their smartphones. Research shows that perceptions of risk change as computing systems change. Chin et. al\ investigate how user attitudes toward security and privacy for smarphones differ from attitudes for traditional computing systems, and find that these attitudes differ significantly ~\cite{chin2012measuring}. How people use these devices had also changed. Palen et. al\ track smartphone users for six weeks to find rapid modifications in behaviors with respect to context and the social appropriateness of phone use cite\{palen2000going}. People also perceive and behave without a realistic understanding of the risks they are taking. Felt et. al\ examine the Android permission system and find that 17\% of participants paid attention to permissions, and only 3\% comprehended what these permissions meant.  

%%% There's way more work in this area that needs to be cited (look at stuff by Janne Lindqvist, Norman Sadeh, Patrick Kelley, and Jason Hong). At the very least, if you don't add new citations, you absolutely need to say 2-3 sentences about the three papers that you did cite. Though I strongly urge you to add more.

\subsection{User Perceptions and Behaviors}
In this paper we focus on measuring people's perceptions of security and privacy risks. One limitation of user perceptions is that people don't always have enough information to make privacy-sensitive decisions; even if they do, they often trade off long-term privacy for short-term benefits~\cite{acquisti2005privacy}. Also, actual behavior may deviate from self-reported behaviors~\cite{jensen2005privacy} and privacy preferences~\cite{spiekermann2001privacy}.

While risk communication for the physical world has been examined for several decades (e.g.,~\cite{Fischhoff,Morgan2001}), research into effectively communicating computer-based risks has only recently been researched. For example, both Garg et al.\ and Blythe et al.\ show that due to varying perceptions and abilities that correlate with demographic factors, computer-based risk communication should employ some degree of demographic targeting~\cite{Garg2012,Blythe2011}. While this work is likely applicable to wearable computing risk communication, we believe that a better understanding of users' risk perceptions in this domain is warranted prior to examining risk communication.
