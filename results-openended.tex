\subsection{Self-Reported Concerns for Wearables}
We also wanted to capture the participants' general reactions to wearable devices as a whole. To do this, we asked the participants the following open-ended question:

\textit{What do you think are the most likely risks associated with wearable devices?}\\[-.5cm]

This question was asked along with demographics questions (but before any IUIPC questions to avoid biasing). The participants were presented with a blank box to write in, with no character limit to their open-ended responses. \\

Without a doubt, the most common self-reported concern of wearables for the average user is the \textit{possible loss of privacy} (see Table \ref{openresponses}). Other significant concerns included being unaware of what the device is collecting, doing, or which information it is using (Being Unaware), long-term health effects caused from wearing the device such as cancer from emf waves (Health), safety hazards from wearing the device such as distractions which cause car accidents (Safety), resulting changes in social behaviors, such as dependencies on devices or spending less time with loved ones (Social Impact), the high financial cost of buying, replacing, or caring for the device (Financial), and information compromise (Security).
