* Submission (full papers)	27 February 2015

* Final papers (revisions)	15 May 2015
* Conference dates	22-23 June 2015

=============================

### Serge TODOs: 
* address why not Cochnan’s Q test or Anova (ask Serge) .. add a footnote to justify why not these tests. 
* clearer demographics and compare w/ general population 
* present more about the regression model? like the model itself. (equations with constants and whatnot) 
* Develop more: nonlinearity—look into interactions within data and recipient (like at end of section 3.1.2, less ad-hoc and for all the questions).  without that, don’t say things like: "Regardless of the data recipient..." (3.1.1).

### Linda TODOs:

Before anything else:
* better intro and framing (AND SEND TO SERGE AND DAVE)! 
* heavy editing pass again to format the paper well
* BETTER RELATED WORK; redo search for papers (human attention; econ-y things)

The rest:
* brainstorming to illuminate why questions were asked 
* discussion on “middle” questions and question distributions
* beef up discussion of tech ratings with new risk/ben tables
* analysis and discussion on high-variance (table with data and recipient sorted by standard deviation for our own looking, then just talk about them in the paper without including them inside)

### J TODOs: 
* Histogram redo/normalization. 
* VUR question rakings table comparing all, public, work, friends, and app, in that order
* Combine the risk and benefits tech ranking table 
* Make sure that are in same sorted order for VUR distributions table and VUR rankings table.
* a table of VUR recipient rankings. 
* a table like we have in the appendix of the collapsed data type and VUR distributions, but of of the top 10 and bottom 10 risky technologies  (will go inline inside the paper with discussion). Look at Table 1 in the paper.pdf; this is what we want, but just with the new table that we have. 

=============================

##### Ignore these reviewer comments: 
* use the full scale instead of 5/not for regression model (reviewer suggestion)
* "more discussion," "more tables" .. there was no room.
* reviewer said: “3. The authors make heavy use of randomizing the order of measurement. Whenever this method is employed, one should make sure that the order indeed did not affect the results.”
